{"name":"MAS Simulation","tagline":"Multi-Agent System (MAS) of Autonomous Vehicles/Robots.","body":"### Welcome to my Project ###\r\nI created a `point class` to represent a vehicle/agent in the system. It includes simple point-mass (linear) dynamic equations, specifications of state and sensor noise (when the agent moves or senses other agents), and several other methods.\r\n\r\nThere is also a `test.py` module that imports the class, runs a multi-agent simulation, plots the results, and displays an animation.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors ###\r\nIn 2013, I (@davidkun) started this project for testing a distributed estimation algorithm. \r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n[Back to my Homepage](http://davidkun.github.io/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
