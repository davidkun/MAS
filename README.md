### Multi-Agent System Simulation ###

This project is intended for use in simulating multi-agent systems, 
comprised of any number of agents, in cooperative control schemes. 
The agents can be non-homogenous, i.e. they can have different dynamics 
and/or sensors, depending on the problem formulation and setup.



An agent (e.g. land vehicle, UAV, etc.) will have:

- state space model
- one or more 'sensors', which can receive simulated measurements (e.g. state, relative distance, etc.)
- communication capability
